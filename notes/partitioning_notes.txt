partition drum samples into:
  bassdrums, snares, hats, rest

generate the partitionPattern from drum beats, create a new makeDrumPartitionBeat and such
or I could map the existing ones full drum beat generators to the four partitions
with drumPartitionPattern in place, generate intraPartitionPattern by generating a floatPattern that you snap into the intraPartitionSamples
