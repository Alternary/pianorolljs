try just introducing some randomness to generateAmbiharmonicSequence
detune or a random tone altogether?
I want there also to be a chance of picking a non-harmonic frequency in multiHarmonic

why does generateSomewhatAmbiharmonicSequence sound so dissonant?

store effected samples on acer

I want different drum samples to be introduced and rotated over time

maybe memoization into inverse

elongate ambient sines, call them ambient_sines_elongated

also rationalSong put into Main.hs.main

I might want to do lazily evaluated lists through javascript generators

have also bass octave jumps


now I need drill pattern to also be something like komplexContinuum

how do I orchestrate all this? maybe make a function that generates and loads a pattern with a pattern name at the end of which is an index number


now, I could make the audio run on any programming framework capable of playing samples and editing files or executing shell commands, since I can generate effects with ffmpeg




I could instead try electron

now how would I play a score?
what I could do is to backend give a copy of the score and play it at the same time as I start movning the time marker on frontend
because sending note signals in real time does not work

I want pure data to also send scores back to pianoroll
also I want the score playing to update when updating the score in frontend, so I want to send the play signals as the notes come under the play marker

then multiple grid levels and drawing multiresolution grid
there is the problem that note position coordinate origins are different based on where position initialized, maybe just compensate
wait, transform should never be used with non-one parameters, because it fucks interact


x, y and w are correctly updated but still it teleports
moving interactNote [x,y,w] fetch into local listeners
it somewhat works
I still need relative and absolute coordinates
and from absolute coordinates and zooms derive relative ones
how do I update absolute coords?


what kind of data to send?
I will have open various instruments and then within those instruments, columns of notes
so, a list of lists of note numbers
not note numbers but rather note frequencies


I want an external piano roll sequencer that outputs midi
although, I do want it to play the notes from pure data
what I could do is take an existing visual piano roll editor and make it play pure data notes

I could even try making my own with some graphics library, either gtk or qt

but for now, I might really only need a piano roll editor for tones and using within pure data step sequencers

also I want to record on that piano roll
playing back notes as keys are pressed has latency, so I might instead use pure data to record notes and then convert into json for the javascript client


generate a bunch of samples and then play them back as percussions, also apply effects to others' samples


I can do real time audio synthesis with javascript
actually, into utils I should place the simple-gain-worklet, or, rather, place utils into.
now, that's really all that I need
although, I would also like to use the worklet to apply real time manipulations to samples


how do I want ambiharmonicLoopContinuum to work?
actually not by mutating a loop into another but mutating a loop, period. only having an initialLoop and not an endLoop
at every iteration there is a chance of a mutation. more precisely, each note has a chance of mutating, a chance of randomness*1/loopLength of mutating. do a loop that loops through the indices of freqs and builds up freqs at the same time


I want parallel chords like harmonies
